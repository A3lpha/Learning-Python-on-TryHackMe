In this room, you will get hands-on with and learn about the scripting programming language Python. Although programming isn't required to succeed in security, it's a great skill to have. As the "Scripting for Pentesters" module demonstrates, being able to program allows you to create security tools and create quick scripts that will aid you in hacking (as well as defending and analysing).

This room will teach you:

Variables
Loops
Functions
Data Structures
If statements
Files
You will be using the code editor (on the right-hand side) to complete exercises and solve challenges. This room will teach you the basics, just enough to give you the knowledge to make your basic scripts. If you want to use your development environment to code, download Python on the official website; which gives you an IDE (integrated development environment) to code in.

In programming, syntax is important as it describes the structure of a valid programming language. In simple terms, syntax tells the computer how to read code using rules that control the structure of symbols, punctuation, and words of a programming language.
