To begin, let's create a simple program that outputs some text.

~~~
# This is an example comment
print("Hello World")
~~~
As you can see from the example code block above, it's just one line (shown on line 2), and when we run this code, it will output the text ```Hello World.``` Let's break this down. In the example, line 1 is a comment, a line starting with a hashtag (#) symbol and is not run by the computer. A comment is written by the programmer (you) to help other people reading the code understand what is going on. 

We can control what is output to the screen by using the print() statement. Anything inside of the parenthesis () will be output. However, because we are printing a string (more on data types later in this room), we have to put them inside of quotations ""

Please note, this room's examples are for Python3.
