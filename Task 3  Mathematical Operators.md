Let's now cover mathematical operators and how they can be applied to Python. Like a calculator, there are operations such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing; using Python, we can code our calculator; after all, programming is just writing rules for the computer to follow given specific inputs and conditions. The table below shows the different operations.

| Operator | Syntax | Example |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Addition         | +               | 1 + 1 = 2 |
| Subtraction      | -               | 5 - 1 = 4 |
| Multiplication   | *               | 10 * 10 = 100 |
| Division	       | /	             | 10 / 2 = 5 |
| Modulus          | %               | 10 % 2 = 0 |
| Exponent         | **              | 5**2  = 25 (52) |


Now that we know basic mathematical operators, let's move on to comparison operators; these play a big part in Python and will be built upon when we look at loops and if statements. These operators are used to evaluate a program's condition at a particular state.

| Symbol | Syntax |
|----------------|------------|
| Greater than | > |
| Less than | < |
| Equal to | == |
| Not Equal to | != |
| Greater than or equal to | >= |
| Less than or equal | <= |
